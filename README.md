# YAMRT - YetAnotherMonoRepoTool
 
Not really usable yet, only published to test itself for the time being. Stay tuned. 


### TODO

- much better test coverage
- publish one project at a time, ensure consistent output (currently publish with output is async)
- execute tests in CircleCI
- Exit code 0 if version has not changed even if sources changed (no forcing publish on every push).
- Exit codes on errors.


#### Ideas:
- sample jenkins file
